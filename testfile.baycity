BCN43:UPDATE:POLICE SEEK HELP IDENTIFYING LOS GATOS BONES

	   BCN43             -UPDATE ON ADVISORY  
	   
	   Los Gatos police are asking for help from the public in identifying  
a youth whose decomposed remains were found by a hiker looking for  
antique bottles on the Los Gatos Creek trail Thursday.
	   A police spokesman says the Santa Clara County Coroner's Office  
estimates that the remains, which were found yesterday afternoon, are 
at least three months old.  He says the head and hands have not been 
located  and investigators are treating the case as a homicide.
	   The bones are believed to be those of a boy 16 or 17 years old and 
about 5 feet 7 inches tall.  The bones were discovered on a trail 
south of East Main Street by 45-year-old homeless Los Gatos resident 
Victor Sakellar.
	   Police say Sakellar bent down to pick up a shiny object when he 
noticed that it was a belt buckle attached to a pair of rotted jeans.  
On further examination, he found leg bones, which he collected before 
notifying police.
	   Matterhorn leather lace-up boots, size 12, are believed to have 
belonged to the victim.  A leather belt was also found that had four 
sections of braided material in the middle along with a metal belt 
buckle that has the word ``Schlitz'' across a world globe.
	   Anyone with information about the find is asked to call Detective 
Sgt. Tricia Friedrich at (408) 354-5257.

BCN45:SF POLICE INVESTIGATE BOMB THREATS

	   BCN45              -ADVISORY
	   
	   San Francisco police are investigating two bomb threats, one at a 
federal credit union on Second Street and another at an automobile 
association office on Mission Street.
	   Sgt. Barbara Davis says the credit union building at 144 Second St. 
was evacuated after a bomb threat was received at about 1 p.m.  Around 
the same time another threat was received at a California State 
Automobile Association office at 1650 Mission St.  Davis said she did 
not know of any evacuations at that location but said both threats  
appear to be hoaxes in reaction to Wednesday's bombing at a federal 
building in  Oklahoma City.
	   No explosive devices were been found at either site.
	   This morning a 37-year-old resident of a Tenderloin district 
residental hotel was arrested after he allegedly threatened another 
resident of the hotel at 411 O'Farrell St. with a gun.
	   Police later found 50 pounds of powdered bomb-making materials in  
the suspect's closet along with a bullet-proof vest, helmet and anti-
Semitic publications.

	   Special Agent Rollin Klink said today that Fan Zhang, a Chinese 
citizen living in Monterey Park, was arrested yesterday when a random 
customs search uncovered the bogus stickers in his luggage.

	   LOS GATOS (BCN)

	   Los Gatos police held a news conference this afternoon along a 

wooded park trail to display some items found on a youth whose bones 

were found by a hiker.

	   The bones were found yesterday afternoon in the hilly park at the 

end of a well-to-do residential street.

	   Police Chief Larry Todd displayed mud-caked boots and a belt found 

on the body, which was buried under some 6 inches of dirt.  He said 

some of the dirt had washed away in recent rains.

	   Investigators are asking for help from the public in identifying 

the boy, believed to be 16 or 17 years old.

	   The remains were found by a homeless man looking for antique 

bottles on the Los Gatos Creek trail.

	   The Santa Clara County Coroner's Office estimates that the remains 

are at least three months old.  Police say the head and hands have not 

been located and investigators are treating the case as a homicide.

	   The boy was believed to be about 5 feet 7 inches tall.

	   Victor Sakellar, who found the bones, told police he bent down to 

pick up a shiny object when he noticed that it was a belt buckle 

attached to a pair of rotted jeans.  On further examination, he found

A leather belt was also found that had four sections of braided 

material in the middle along with a metal belt buckle that has the 

word ``Schlitz'' across a world globe.

	   Todd said the youth was probably wearing a red or maroon short-

sleeved sport shirt over a white T-shirt.

	   Anyone with information about the find is asked to call Detective 

Sgt. Tricia Friedrich at (408) 354-5257.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)

	   A U.S. Customs Service agent said today in San Francisco that an 

alleged smuggler in possession of some 29,000 counterfeit software 

authentication holograms has been arrested at San Francisco airport.

	   At a news conference at the Customs office, special agent Rollin 

Klink said 33-year-old Fan Zhang, a Chinese citizen living in Monterey 

Park, was arrested yesterday afternoon as he tried to bring the fake 

stickers into the country in a suitcase.

	   Microsoft officials say the seized goods represent a potential 

revenue loss to their company of more than $840,000.

	   Klink said Zhang, who moved to California recently from South 

Dakota whre he was in school, admitted that he traveled to Shanghai 

April 18 to purchase the bogus holograms.

	   The holograms are used on certificates of authentification sold 

with MS-DOS 6.2 software and enable the software's purchasers to 

receive upgrades and services for the products.

	   Klink said Zhang took $3,000 to China to purchase the counterfeit 

holograms which he planned to sell for around $10,000 to software 

pirates.

	   The counterfeit holograms are round and luminous and about the size 

of a quarter.  they look very similar to the real thing but are 

smaller and have design differences.

	   Klink said customs agents know the location of the counterfeiting 

factory in China and hope to work with Chinese officials to raid it 

and shut it down.

	   Zhang faces federal smuggling, trafficking and false entry charges.  

If convicted he could receive fines of more than $2 million, as well 

as 15 years in prison.

	   He was scheduled to appear this afternoon in federal court in San 

Francisco.

	   BCN52                -ADVISORY
	   
	   Gov. Pete Wilson today announced the appointment of Bennett S. 
Sparks to the California Veterans Board.
	   Sparks, a 69-year-old resident of Windsor in Sonoma County, has 
served as a rear admiral of the U.S. Coast Guard since 1985.  Prior to 
joining the Coast Guard, he served as president and chief operating 
officer of Russwood Inc.
	   Sparks, a Republican, is involved in several community and veterans 
organizations.
	   The California Veterans Board is an advisory board to the governor, 
the Legislature and director of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It 
has three major functions: to determine policies for department 
operations, to consider and decide appeals by applicants for 
California veterans benefits and to participate in setting interest 
rates for Cal-Vet loans.
	   Board members do not receive a salary. 
	   Sparks' appointment is subject to Senate confirmation.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)

	   A spokesman for San Francisco police says a Tenderloin district 

hotel resident arrested this morning after bomb-making materials were 

found in his room has been identified as Richard Payne.

	   Lt. Ron Roth of Special Investigations says Payne faces felony 

explosives charges but the District Attorney's Office has not 

determined specific charges.

	   Payne, who has given police two birth dates, making him either 36 

or 38 years old, was arrested in his fourth-floor room at the Columbia 

Hotel at 411 O'Farrell St. after he allegedly threatened another 

resident with a gun.

	   Police Cmdr. Dennis Martel says police later found 50 pounds of 

powdered bomb-making materials in Payne's closet along with a bullet-

proof vest and helmet.

	   FBI Special Agent Doug Perez said anti Semitic literature was also 

found in Payne's room, as were several obituaries of men who have died 

of AIDS-related ailments.

	   Several O'Farrell Street buildings between Taylor and Jones streets 

were evacuated and cordoned off for about two hours this morning while 

police searched the hotel.

	   A Santa Clara County prosecutor says Campbell sheet-metal worker  
Phillip Phiko will probably be formally charged next week with  
kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 12-year-old San Jose girl.
	   Deputy District Attorney Victoria Dwinnells said Phiko, 51, is 
already scheduled to enter a plea in San Jose Municipal Court on April 
26 to a charge that he enticed the sixth-grader to run away with him. 
An amended complaint was filed today charging Phiko with two counts of  
committing lewd acts on a minor using force and one count of  
kidnapping.
	   The two were missing for 13 days together before they were 
discovered Monday night in a Pomona motel.
	   Dwinnells said prosecutors have no reason to believe the child was  
forced to run away with Phiko.  But she said he can be charged with 
kidnapping because he allegedly showed intent to commit the lewd acts.
	   Thanh Lam, one of the child's cousins, said the girl has not been  
returned home yet.  Police said yesterday that she is being  
interviewed by social workers from Santa Clara County Child Protective  
Services.

	   Santa Cruz police today identified a woman whose body was found at  
a downtown trailer court Thursday after a man told Arizona officials  
he had killed her.
	   Deputy Police Chief David Larson said this afternoon that 34-year-
old Elmer Laurance Matthews apparently killed 49-year-old Cheri Lea 
Carmody, with whom he had a domestic relationship.
	   Larson said Matthews told an Arizona Department of Public Safety  
officer that he killed Carmody on Wednesday and that he wanted to turn  
himself in as the officer stopped to help him after seeing his  
disabled vehicle at a rest stop on a highway near Phoenix.
	   Arizona Department of Public Safety officials called early Thursday  
to report Matthews' claim to Santa Cruz police, who went to Carmody's  
home at the El Rio Mobile Home Park at 2120 N. Pacific and found her  
body there.
	   Larson said Santa Cruz police and Santa Cruz County district  
attorney's investigators have already arrested Matthews in Arizona and 
charged him with homicide.  He said Matthews waived extradition 
proceedings at a court proceeding in Arizona this morning and will be 
returned to California and booked into Santa Cruz County Jail tonight.

	   The head of a Berkeley-based advocacy group for Middle Easterners 
said today that people in his community are ``relieved'' that two men 
arrested today as suspects in the Oklahoma City bombing are not Middle 
Easterners.
	   But Moji Agha of Persian-speaking And Middle Eastern Community 
Services said his community has experienced two days of ``intense fear 
and anxiety'' as a result of the Wednesday bombing.
	   Agha said Middle Easterners throughout the United States have been 
harassed because of initial reports that Middle Easterners might have 
been responsible for the bombing.  He said the incident made them 
relive tense periods in the past during which they were harassed, such 
as the Iran hostage crisis and the Persian Gulf War.
	   Agha said President Clinton or some other government leader should 
publicly apologize to the 6 or 7 million Middle Eastern people in the 
United States.
	   Agha said he is not aware of any recent acts of violence against 
Middle Easterners in this country but he said there have been 
instances of verbal harassment.
